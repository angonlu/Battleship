For this app, users will be able to find where in the U.S. they want to live in terms of cost of living. It’s not necessarily to find the most affordable but what they want based off of specific user inputs. We want to target young adults who are entering the “real world” to users who are looking to find a location to start a family. 
 
Some example use cases, are a newly graduated user, who just got a job. This user will be able to use our app to find a place based on the average salary/income, cost of living, average home price, job market  etc. Another one is that if you already current live in an area and want to relocate, to a different area that is comparable etc.
